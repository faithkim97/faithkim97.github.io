<p>Hi! My name is Faith Kim, and I'm a third year student at Smith College studying <b>Computer Science</b> with a focus in game development.</p>

<p>I am a game programmer for <span class = "bold">GlowLime Games</span>, an organization located in Hampshire College dedicated to releasing cool games developed
by Five college students. I primarily use <b>Unity (C#)</b> for the development process,
but I also like to create small visual novels in <b>Renpy</b> for personal pleasures. </p>
<p>I'm always striving to write clean and efficient code for my projects, and I am ready to learn new skills to successfully develop a game.</p>

<p>I also love being involved in my house and Computer Science communities. I am the current Student Academic Advisor for my house, where
I advise new students what courses to take, help them adjust to the new college environment, and provide information on registering for
classes for both our home institution and Five Colleges.<p>
</br>
<p>I am also the Event Chair of Smithies in Computer Science, a student organization dedicated to inspiring more students to be 
involved in tech. We are currently organizing a tech lunch series learning more about the application process for tech internships, 
and we also plan on holding workshops for beginners on how to code a website in HTML/CSS; and our largest event will be Smith's Hackathon, which
will be happening in Spring 2018.</p>

<p>On the fun side, I really enjoy reading tarot cards and astrologies for my friends! </p>
