    <p>Hey everyone! Thanks for checking out my website! I'm Faith, and
      I'm a third year student at Smith College studying Computer Science.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>I'm really interested in Computer Graphics and game programming, so I'm
      focusing my studies on making personal games using game engines like <p1><b>Unity</b></p1> and <p1><b>Unreal Engine,</b></p1>
      and I also love creating visual novels with <p1><b>RenPy!</b></p1>
      To take my game programming to the next level, I will be more active in GlowLime Games, a student
      organization in Hampshire College dedicated to creating video games.</p>

      <br>
      <p>In a team environment, I'm usually the one organizing the division of labor and directing people
        to specific duties. I really like to keep my team organized and efficient, but most importantly
        make the job as fun as possible for any projects we work on!</p>
      <br>
      <p>I also <p1><b>create websites on WIX</b></p1> for people who need one for their restaurant, personal use and/or
        for other forms of business. Here is a sample website I made:

        <p1><a href = "https://www.uknowbistro.com/">U Know Bistro</a></p1>

      </p>



    <p>Outside of programming, I love playing music (I play the guitar, clarinet, and piano), drawing (I like
      to draw my visual novel characters on Paint Tool SAI), cooking, and writing!</p>
