<p>Hi! My name is Faith Kim, and I'm a senior at Smith College studying <b>Computer Science</b> specializing in software development.</p>

<p>Because of my deep love for video games, I worked as a game programmer for <span class = "bold"><a href = "http://glowlime.com/">GlowLime Games</a></span>, an organization located in Hampshire College dedicated to releasing cool games developed
by Five college students. I primarily used <b>Unity (C#)</b> for the development process,
but I also liked to create small visual novels in <b>Renpy</b> for personal pleasures. </p>
<p>This past summer 2018, I was part of the Enterprise Pricing System team at CME Group, working as a software engineer intern and connecting with people who helped me grow as a developer.</p>
<p>I'm always striving to write clean and efficient code for my projects, and I am ready to learn new skills to successfully develop a product.</p>

<p>I also love being involved in Smith's Computer Science community. I work as a teaching assistant for Data Structures (Java), where evening hours are held Sunday-Thursday. As a TA, 
I help explain conceptual questions regarding how specific data structures/common algorithms work (BFT, DFT, etc..), make <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7lg1jNJrOU9x6k7xi5hyWw">review videos</a> for each data structures throughout the semester, and I offer the most help in reading error messages and step them through how to debug their codes. </p>
<p>
Furthermore, I also hold a board member position for Smithies in Computer Science; I was the Events Chair of Smithies in CS for the 2017-2018 academic year, and I am the the Vice President
for the 2018-2019 academic year. Smithies in Computer Science is a student organization dedicated to inspiring more students to be 
involved in tech, where we organize tech lunch series for landing tech internships, hold workshops on programming languages (Julia, HTML, etc.), and organize HackSmith, the largest event organized by Smithies in CS.
If you would like to know more about our initiatives/events we hold as a student org, please follow us on our <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/pg/SmithiesInCS/photos/?ref=page_internal">Facebook page!</a>
</p>

<p>On the fun side, I really enjoy reading tarot cards and astrologies for my friends! On my spare time, I like snuggling in with a book and coffee or play video games.</p>
