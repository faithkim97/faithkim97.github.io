<p>Hi! My name is Faith Kim, and I'm a third year student at Smith College studying <b>Computer Science</b> with an interest in game development.</p>

<p>I am a game programmer for <span class = "bold">GlowLime Games</span>, an organization located in Hampshire College dedicated to releasing cool games developed
by Five college students. I primarily use <b>Unity (C#)</b> for the development process,
but I also like to create small visual novels in <b>Renpy</b> for personal pleasures. </p>
<p>I'm always striving to write clean and efficient code for my projects, and I am ready to learn new skills to successfully develop a game/product.</p>

<p>I also love being involved in Smith's Computer Science community. I am the current Events Chair of Smithies in Computer Science, a student organization dedicated to inspiring more students to be 
involved in tech. We organize tech lunch series for landing tech internships, hold workshops on programming languages (Julia, HTML, etc.), and we will be holding Smith's annual Hackathon, the largest event organized by Smithies in CS.
</p>

<p>On the fun side, I really enjoy reading tarot cards and astrologies for my friends! On my spare time, I like snuggling in with a book and coffee or play Overwatch.</p>
